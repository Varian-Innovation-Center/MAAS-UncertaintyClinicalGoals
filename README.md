# MAAS-UncertaintyClinicalGoals
This project's purpose is to evaluate the planâ€™s Clinical Goals against the doses for all of its uncertainty scenarios.

The Clinical Goal - Uncertainty Scenario pairs are tabulated in an HTML report, and saved as CSV and/or JSON data files.
In addition, Min/Max robust dose plans can be generated, where each dose voxel represents the smallest/largest dose out of all uncertainty scenarios.

<br />
The Clinical Goals in ESAPI require Eclipse v16 or newer.

This repository will work to offer updated versions of this project with precomiled binaries for your specific Eclipse version in the future.
